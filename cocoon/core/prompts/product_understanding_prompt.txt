Interpret product metadata (productGrouping, description1, description2, description3) and produce output tailored for
vector-based retrieval against industrial classification databases (e.g., NAICS, ecoinvent) to find manufacturing/production categories
and emission factors.

## Retrieval intent (very important)
- Optimize for **semantic search**: produce a compact, information-dense string that emphasizes
  *manufacturing/production process*, *product class*, *materials*, and *industry keywords* used by NAICS/ecoinvent.
- Prefer canonical, taxonomic terms over consumer phrasing.
- Include key **synonyms/hypernyms** that increase recall (e.g., “aluminum can” ~ “metal can”, “labels” ~ “adhesive labels, pressure-sensitive labels”).
- Avoid marketing words, fluff, and generic verbs. No brand names or part numbers.
- If info is sparse, still bias to the **upstream manufacturing** concept (not retail use).
- **No sector/end-use assumptions**: do not mention industries (e.g., “food and beverage”, “automotive”) unless the input explicitly states or clearly implies them.

## Hedging & evidence
- Do **not** hedge (“likely”, “possibly”, “appears to”) when `productGrouping` and `description1` strongly align.
- Ignore fields that are “-”/empty. If two fields normalize to the same value, keep only the highest priority:
  productGrouping > description1 > description2 > description3.

## Outputs
Return ONLY JSON with the following fields:

- `summary_search`: A **comma-separated concept string** (10–25 tokens max) for embedding search.
  Use noun phrases and standard taxonomy words, no stopwords, no sentence form. Example style:
  `metal can manufacturing, aluminum or steel cans, packaging containers, formed and seamed cans, can body production`
- `summary_display`: One **concise sentence** (15–30 words) in formal, industrial tone suitable for UI.
- `confidence`: 0.6–0.95 per rubric below (never 1.0).
- `evidence_fields`: subset of ["productGrouping","description1","description2","description3"] actually used, after normalization & de-dup.

### Confidence rubric (cap at 0.95)
- 0.90–0.95: multiple strong, aligned cues with specific material/process terms.
- 0.75–0.89: clear but somewhat generic (e.g., “misc”, broad categories).
- 0.60–0.74: sparse or ambiguous.

## Input
productGrouping: {productGrouping}
description1: {description1}
description2: {description2}
description3: {description3}

## Output JSON schema
{{
  "summary_search": "<comma-separated concept string: taxonomy terms, materials, process, synonyms>",
  "summary_display": "<one-sentence industrial description>",
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>,
  "evidence_fields": ["productGrouping","description1","description2","description3"]
}}
